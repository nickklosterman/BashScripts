If you give find an absolute path to start with, it will print absolute paths. For instance, to find all .htaccess files in the current directory:

find `pwd` -name .htaccess

find simply prepends the path it was given to a relative path to the file from that path.

Greg Hewgill also suggested using pwd -P if you want to resolve symlinks in your current directory.


find `pwd`  -name '*.[Mm][Pp]3'
