Sourcing .alias file: I was trying to source .alias by adding code to source it if it existed in .bash_profile but this wasn't being picked up. I then moved the code to .bashrc and it was executed. Here is a good explanation of how / when things are being sourced: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/415403/whats-the-difference-between-bashrc-bash-profile-and-environment
a)
The main difference with shell config files is that some are only read by "login" shells (eg. when you login from another host, or login at the text console of a local unix machine). these are the ones called, say, .login or .profile or .zlogin (depending on which shell you're using).
Then you have config files that are read by "interactive" shells (as in, ones connected to a terminal (or pseudo-terminal in the case of, say, a terminal emulator running under a windowing system). these are the ones with names like .bashrc, .tcshrc, .zshrc, etc.
bash complicates this in that .bashrc is not only read by interactive shells, but also non-login shells, so you'll find most people end up telling their .bash_profile to also read .bashrc with something like
[[ -r ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc
Other shells behave differently - eg with zsh, .zshrc is always read for an interactive shell, whether it's a login one or not.
The manual page for bash explains the circumstances under which each file is read. Yes, behaviour is generally consistent between machines.
.profile is simply the login script filename originally used by /bin/sh. bash, being generally backwards-compatible with /bin/sh, will read .profile if one exists.
b)
That's simple. It's explained in man bash:
/bin/bash
       The bash executable
/etc/profile
       The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells
~/.bash_profile
       The personal initialization file, executed for login shells
~/.bashrc
       The individual per-interactive-shell startup file
~/.bash_logout
       The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits
~/.inputrc
       Individual readline initialization file
Login shells are the ones that are read one you login (so, they are not executed when merely starting up xterm, for example). There are other ways to login. For example using an X display manager. Those have other ways to read and export environment variables at login time.
Also read the INVOCATION chapter in the manual. It says "The following paragraphs describe how bash executes its startup files.", i think that's a spot-on :) It explains what an "interactive" shell is too.
Bash does not know about .environment. I suspect that's a file of your distribution, to set environment variables independent of the shell that you drive.

Cygwin Navigation outside of cygwin directory:
http://superuser.com/questions/229870/how-to-access-different-directories-outside-cygwin-home-dir
You can access the root of your C: drive, for example, from cygwin by specifying the directory /cygdrive/c, e.g.,
$ cd /cygdrive/c
Similarly, the path to any file on your C: drive can be constructed by prefixing the Windows path (without the "C:" and with \s changed to /s) with /cygdrive/c, so C:\Dropbox\myfile would be accessed from within Cygwin as /cygdrive/c/Dropbox/myfile.
If you really wanted it available in Cygwin, besides getting it directly (as @garyjohn's correct answer) you can also try to use the mount command to map the path to your home dir. Something like this may work.
mount C:\dropbox\cygwin /home/me/dropbox
I say may, because though I'm pretty sure it will work, I have no Cygwin install to test it, and I'm not sure if Cygwin will refuse to create it because of filesystem loops (it should allow it)
As @starcorn mentions above, ln works great for this.
$ ln -sv /cygdrive/c/Users/JohnWagg/Dropbox/ ~/dropbox
`/home/JohnWagg/dropbox' -> `/cygdrive/c/Users/JohnWagg/Dropbox/'

PHP & MySQL: need to alias the count(*) fields bc php barfs when trying to pares it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/797335/mysql-count-into-php-variable
// Changed the query - there's no need for DISTINCT
// and aliased the count as "num"
$data = mysql_query('SELECT COUNT(`users_id`) AS num FROM `users_table`') or die(mysql_error());
// A COUNT query will always return 1 row
// (unless it fails, in which case we die above)
// Use fetch_assoc for a nice associative array - much easier to use
$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($data);
// Get the number of uses from the array
// 'num' is what we aliased the column as above
$numUsers = $row['num'];
---> because $row['count(*)'] ; doesn't work.

I brought in Cam's laptop and hooked it up to an external monitor. The screen image was showing up half way up the monitor. Other than that everything was copacetic. The mouse worked et etc. I waas at first going to blame X but it really was just that the vertical position on the monitor had been set way crazy.

I then attempted to sync up Git items but I was getting an error where "ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host\n fatal: Could not read from remote repository.\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\n and the repository exists." This was being caused by the ssh-agent not running. I am assuming that after the re-install I didn't have the ssh-agent automatically spawned like it was in the past or that somehow it changed.
eval $(ssh-agent)
and things are all ok.

Python 2 to 3: use 2to3 tool to modify code and create valid python 3 code from python 2
you'll need to make a backup of the file.
use the -w switch to write the changes out to the file.

CLI Expansions: (from http://lifehacker.com/5743814/become-a-command-line-ninja-with-these-time+saving-shortcuts)
When you're working with variations of a file—like backups or different file types—it can get tedious typing out the same commands with small tweaks. Using the brace symbols ({}), you can easily perform batch operations on multiple versions of a file.
Say you want to rename just part of a filename. Instead of typing out mv /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.xml, you could just run:
    mv /path/to/file.{txt,xml}
This runs the command with the same arguments, only with the parts inside the brace changed—the first part corresponding to the first argument, the second part corresponding to the second argument.
The most common example of this is when you're backing up a file that you're making changes to. For example, if you are tweaking your rc.conf, you'll want to make a backup in case the new one doesn't work. So, to do so, you can just run:
    sudo cp /etc/rc.conf{,-old}
Putting nothing before the comma will just append -old to the filename after copying it with cp. If your new file doesn't work out and you want to restore the backed up file to its original location, you can just use:
    sudo mv /etc/rc.conf{-old,}
Moving the comma to the other end of the brace will remove -old from the end of the file and restore it to its original name.
The braces can also work when moving or creating multiple files at once. For example, if you wanted to create three numbered directories, you could just run:
    mkdir myfolder{1,2,3}
This will create three folders: myfolder1, myfolder2, and myfolder3.

mv: cannot move `./directory1' to `../directory2': Directory not empty (from http://desdecode.blogspot.com/2011/11/mv-cannot-move-directory1-to-directory2.html )
I wanted to move all files from one directory structure to another, for me I had an updated version of a lot of website files and I wanted to update them all in one go so I tried:
    mv ./directory1/* ./directory2/
Because I have lots of files within sub-directories on both folders the mv command wouldn't play nice and kept throwing this "Directory not empty" error, even doing an "mv -f" to force overrides didn't work..
After search around people have come up with elaborate bash scripts to do the task, and I like to throw a bash script together every now and again but in this situation it's really not necessary, we just need to use rsync:
    rsync -avh ./directory2/ ./directory1/
That rsync command will override all the files in directory1 with the files in directory2 and recurse through all sub-directories, it will override them regardless if they're older/newer/different sized etc so do a backup of your original directory before running the command

Emacs Mode for files not ending with '.py' : http://emacswiki.org/emacs/PythonProgrammingInEmacs#toc20
You can set the mode for python files with file names not ending with ..py. by adding line
# -*- python -*-
or
# -*- Mode: Python; tab-width: 4 -*-
as second line in your file (the first usually being #!/usr/bin/env python).
also http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/python/20112 states 
M-x python-mode or M-x load-file
may be needed first to load python-mode.el
or
I use this in my .emacs, which looks for the word "python" in
the shebang line:
------------------------------
(setq interpreter-mode-alist
(cons '("python" . python-mode) interpreter-mode-alist))
------------------------------ 
or
Check out the Emacs Info system for the topic Local Variables.
In short, at the *END* of the file you can have the following:
### Local Variables:
### mode:python
### tab-width:4
### End:
The important bits are a line containing "Local Variables:" , a line
containing "End: ", then any number variable names and values set
between those two lines. The lines can start with a comment character
appropriate for the contents of the file (e.g. "###" for Python).
or
You shouldn't need all that gunk. With most modern Emacsen, there's a
variable called interpreter-mode-alist which (at least with XEmacs)
has a default mapping for Python. Sticking
#! /usr/bin/env python
at the top of the file is enough to drop you in Python mode. This is
covered in the Python Mode installation instructions at
http://www.python.org/emacs/python-mode/installation.html
or
I bet there is someway to modify the python-mode.el file to accept other files types.

sqlite3 list tables in database:http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html or see below
sqlite3 check if table exists: from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1601151/how-do-i-check-in-sqlite-whether-a-table-exists and  http://sqlite.org/faq.html#q7
From within a C/C++ program (or a script using Tcl/Ruby/Perl/Python bindings) you can get access to table and index names by doing a SELECT on a special table named "SQLITE_MASTER". Every SQLite database has an SQLITE_MASTER table that defines the schema for the database. The SQLITE_MASTER table looks like this:

CREATE TABLE sqlite_master (
  type TEXT,
  name TEXT,
  tbl_name TEXT,
  rootpage INTEGER,
  sql TEXT
);
For tables, the type field will always be 'table' and the name field will be the name of the table. So to get a list of all tables in the database, use the following SELECT command:
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type='table'
ORDER BY name;
e.g.:sqlite3 IBDdatabase.sqlite " select case when tbl_name ='BC20StockData' then 1 else 0 end  from sqlite_master where type='table' and name='BC20StockData' order by name" 
-->returns 1 if it exists

-changing the "index" node changes which tab  is used. uses 1 based indexing and not 0 based.
I think this corresponds to the docIdentifier field.
If the index is set to an invalid identifier it will open a blank 'new tab' if you set the index field to a negative value or it will open the tab with the highest index for an index that is greater than the greatest valid identifier/index.
-use json_reformat and json_verify on the file. need to cat it in tho. or throw code into http://www.shell-tools.net/index.php?op=json_format or http://jsonlint.com/ to prettify the script and organize into a readable structure. Will need to run this 00> sed 's/,"children"/,\n"children"/g;s/{"url":/\n{"url":/g' to break up the single line entry into something that you can copy and paste into the online tool. 
-I've been successful in parsing the individual entries using : sed 's/{"entries":/\n{"entries":/g' sessionstore-18.js > sessionstore-18_entries.js and then copying the 'entries' line I separated and adding it into a brand new sessionstore file that was generated after the crash. 
-Even though most people don't have multiple windows there are also options/keywords in the xml/json for mutliple windows.
It doesn't look like there is a simple way to load sessionstore data into the browser without renaming the suspect files sessionstore.js and then 'rebooting' FF.
-The OP who started the bugzilla thread stated that using http://sessionmanager.mozdev.org stated that they installed sessionmanager.mozdev.org and hasn't had a repeat of the problem.

TypeError: GetTicker() takes no arguments (1 given)
--> this means that you forgot to define the function with the argument self i.e. def GetTicker() ---> def GetTicker(self):

Emacs
elisp file names must all be lower case. Otherwise, you'll get an "emacs required feature Somepackage.el was not provided"

Recursively make a copy of a file in the same directory with the extension changed.
find . -name "*.js" -exec sh -c 'name={}; cp $name ${name%.js}.ts' \;
--> this will recursively find *.js files and create *.ts copies in the same directory
find . -name "*.js" -exec bash -c 'name="{}"; cp "$name" "${name%.js}.ts"' \;
find allows you to execute a command directly on a file found using -exec; you don't need to pipe it through xargs. It takes the command name followed by arguments to the command, followed by a single argument ;, which you have to escape to avoid the shell interpreting it. find will replace any occurrence of {} in the command name or arguments with the file found.
In order call a command with the appropriate ending substituted, there are multiple approaches you can take, but a simple one is to use Bash's parameter expansion. You need to define a shell parameter that contains the name (in this case, I creatively chose name={}), and then you can use parameter expansion on it. ${variable%suffix} strips off suffix from the value of $variable; I then add on .ts to the end, and have the name I'm looking for.

$ bash ../JStoTS.sh
../JStoTS.sh: line 43: syntax error near unexpected token `$ts_file'
../JStoTS.sh: line 43: `CleanEndingParensBrackets() $ts_file'
--> this is because you need to remove the () on the function name when calling it. It is even optional when defining a function (although it adds to portability according to abs-guide.pdf).

google:emacs open file and enter date
Emacs enter date into file
C-u M-! date 
M-! is the keyboard shortcut for the function shell-command. So M-! date will call the shell command date, and show it in the output area (the minibuffer, since the output is short enough to fit). The C-u is a prefix argument that makes M-! put its output in the current buffer instead.

sed '/---/!s/--/\\(em/g'
this script will only replace double dashes but not triple dashes
It says, simply, "If you find a line containing three consecutive hyphens, don't apply the edit." On
all other lines, the substitute command will be applied.

from O'reilly sed & awk 2nd ed: sect 4.4.1
s/\.  */.  /g
This command replaces a period followed by any number of spaces with a period followed by two
spaces. It should be noted that the previous command reduces multiple spaces to one, so that only one
space will be found following a period.[4] Nonetheless, this pattern works regardless of how many
spaces follow the period, as long as there is at least one. (It would not, for instance, affect a filename of
the form test.ext if it appeared in the document.)

sed:The N command reads another line into the pattern space without removing the current line, so you can test for patterns across multiple lines

sed: unmatched parens:
$ echo "                 Class(\"I.ViewChassis.DialogView\", I.ViewChassis.ComponentView, {" | sed -n 's/^[ ]*Class\(/-::-/p'
sed: -e expression #1, char 21: Unmatched ( or \(
you can put the offending character into its own character class if you can't get it escaped
$ echo "                 Class(\"I.ViewChassis.DialogView\", I.ViewChassis.ComponentView, {" | sed -n 's/^[ ]*Class[(]"/-::-/p'

http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/regex.htm more regexp goodness

it appears that sed doesn't support POSIX character classes.
Also all seds aren'te equal Linux sed != Mac sed
ed does allow use of POSIX character classes but it isn't stream/line oriented. it reads in the entire file.
sed uses BRE (basic regular expressions). Look this up to find what exactly it supports/doesn't


http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/linux_tool_guides/the_sed_faq/sedfaq3_010.html
Though character classes don't generally conserve space on the line, they help make scripts portable for international use. The equivalent character sets for U.S. users follows:
     [[:alnum:]]  - [A-Za-z0-9]     Alphanumeric characters
     [[:alpha:]]  - [A-Za-z]        Alphabetic characters
     [[:blank:]]  - [ \x09]         Space or tab characters only
     [[:cntrl:]]  - [\x00-\x19\x7F] Control characters
     [[:digit:]]  - [0-9]           Numeric characters
     [[:graph:]]  - [!-~]           Printable and visible characters
     [[:lower:]]  - [a-z]           Lower-case alphabetic characters
     [[:print:]]  - [ -~]           Printable (non-Control) characters
     [[:punct:]]  - [!-/:-@[-`{-~]  Punctuation characters
     [[:space:]]  - [ \t\v\f]       All whitespace chars
     [[:upper:]]  - [A-Z]           Upper-case alphabetic characters
     [[:xdigit:]] - [0-9a-fA-F]     Hexadecimal digit characters

This script marches through grabbing sets of two and spitting out only a single character. So if there isn't a set of two it simply outputs the character

http://superuser.com/questions/336816/regex-find-and-replace-with-sed-matching-group-and-replacing-on-condition
You can reference groups you just defined, but sed uses \n, not $n, for that. In addition, grouping with ( ) only works in "extended" mode (enable with the -r option):
sed -r 's/^(.+) - \1/\1/'
In "basic" mode, you'd use:
sed 's/^\(.*\) - \1/\1/'
AAaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh the -r option
It seems that the -r option allows you to use regexp the way most regexp editors show them without the escaped parens etc. 

$ echo " abccddefgh" | sed 's/.*[[:alpha:]]\1\+/9/'
sed: -e expression #1, char 22: Invalid back reference
$ echo " abccddefgh" | sed 's/[[:alpha:]]\1\+/9/'
sed: -e expression #1, char 20: Invalid back reference

put the [[:alpha:]] in a group 
$ echo " abccddefgh" | sed 's/\([[:alpha:]]\)\1\+/9/'
 ab9ddefgh
now make it global
$ echo " abccddefgh" | sed 's/\([[:alpha:]]\)\1\+/9/g'
 ab99efgh
now try the r option 
$ echo " abccddefgh" | sed -r 's/\([[:alpha:]]\)\1\+/9/g'
sed: -e expression #1, char 25: Invalid back reference
remove all the unnecessary escaping
$ echo " abccddefgh" | sed -r 's/([[:alpha:]])\1+/9/g'
 ab99efgh

Using backreferences : taken from http://www.regular-expressions.info/brackets.html
To figure out the number of a particular backreference, scan the regular expression from left to right and count the opening round brackets. The first bracket starts backreference number one, the second number two, etc. Non-capturing parentheses are not counted. This fact means that non-capturing parentheses have another benefit: you can insert them into a regular expression without changing the numbers assigned to the backreferences. This can be very useful when modifying a complex regular expression

newline in echo:
The mixed history of echo means its default operation varies from shell to shell.
It is more reliable to use printf (either as a built-in command or an external command) where the behavior is more well defined: the C-style backslash escapes and format specifiers are supported in the format string (the first argument).
printf 'foo\nbar\n'

To find the last modified files in a directory you can use ls -ltr. To find the last modified file on a file system it will not work, but the following command will work:
comments for this post:
find /etc -type f -printf "%T@ %T+ %p\n" | sort -n
Yes, I also had to add '\n'.  I also piped through 'sort -rn|head' to limit the output.  It's also possible to speed things up by using the test '-cnewer' in 'find'.  Just picking any file in the directory your searching.  If you don't get any output you've managed to pick the most recent modified file.
sudo find /etc -type f -printf "%T@ %T+ %p \n" | sort -n | less
i simply use:find . -type f -mtime 0

Open SSH Key Management:
from the ssh key archwiki(https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SSH_Keys) and the open ssh key management page on IBM developerworks http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc/index.html http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-keyc2/ http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-keyc3/
1)generate ssh key
ssh-keygen -b 521 -t ecdsa -C "$(id -un)@$(hostname)-$(date --rfc-3339=date)"
or
ssh-keygen -b 521 -t ecdsa -C "$(whoami)@$(hostname)-$(date -I)"
2)copy key to remote machines
use ssh-copy-id or scp -P portnumber ~/.ssh/keyyoumade.pub usera@host:
you need th etrialing colot to specify which directory to place it in.
the ':' places it in /home/user/
3) on the REMOTE machine copy / append the key you just copied to 
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
cat nick.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Note: at this point you have passphrase autnetication setup but will need to enter in the passpharase for every new connection and every new shell
4)  make use of ssh variavles
eval `ssh-agent`
or
eval $(ssh-agent)
5) add your RSA private key to the ssh-agent cache
ssh-add ~/.ssh/privatekey (not the .pub one)
now that the passphrase is in the cache you can establish connections without supplying your passphrase
6)download and install the keychain script written by Daniel Robbines.
edit your .bash_profile to include;
/usr/bin/keychain ~/.ssh/privatekey1 ~/.ssh/privatekey2 .....
source ~/.ssh-agent > /dev/null
source ~/.bashrc
7) logout and login and enter your passphrase when prompted.
8) tada! done

the last two would be more for usage. also checking the shell history would be useful
also /var/log/messages can hold logs of successful ssh attempts

Bignicky HDD into Dell (HDD migration)
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Q:_After_updating_my_system.2C_I_get_a_.22unable_to_find_root_device.22_error_after_rebooting_and_my_system_will_no_longer_boot.
After the bignicky motherboard died because of the blown caps I took the HDD out and placed it in the Dell. Upon boot I got "
Waiting 10 seconds for /dev/sda1
ERROR: Unable to find root device '/dev/sda1'
You are being dropped to a recovery shell
"
I booted into the arch installation CD
https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1062638
ls /dev/s* 
--> see what partitions there are on the HDD that wont' mount
It showed four partitions so at the root prompt I created four directories.
mkdir one two three four
then ls /dev/sda
actually I think the command was
blkid -o list -c /dev/null 
--> view device information from wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Persistent_block_device_naming
I then mounted the partitions onto the mount point directories that I made. you only really need to mount the partition that holds the OS and the boot partition.  I'm pretty sure I don't have a separate boot partition so I didn't need to worry about mounting that. It appeared that the partitions were OS, home,swap, and tmp. Now move into the folder where you mounted the OS. Here I mounted the OS on the "one" mountpoint.
cd one
at this point we are going to mount appropriate thinsg so that when we perform the update it is performed on the OS on the HDD and not the temporary OS afforded by the arch installation disc
mount -t proc proc proc/
mount -t sysfs sys sys/
mount -o bind /dev/ dev/
we need to use the change root command 
chroot . /bin/bash
-->that last step was a key step
setup the wired network
dhcpcd eth0
now update the system
pacman -Syy
pacman -Syu 
pacman -S udev
pacman -S mkinitcpio
mkinitcpio -p linux 
reboot
This fixed the problem. I'm not sure if it was an update problem or new harddware or a problem caused by the caps blowing while the system was running.

I re-encountered the above problem when trying to perform an update and encountering the problem with /lib moving to /usr/lib. I initially threw the nicky drive into the dell and it worked fine. I updated and it seemed that the update ran fine. I then rebooted to double check and got the above error. This gave the following error:
error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
glibc: /lib exists in filesystem
Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.
I followed the instructions here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/DeveloperWiki:usrlib
The install was relatively new and the update took care of removing items unrelated to glibc in /lib. This : https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Q:_I_get_an_error_when_updating:_.22file_exists_in_filesystem.22.21 is related to the problems I was having. I nutted up and moved /lib to /usr/libold.  I then to pacman update and it returned "bash: /usr/pacman no such file or directory" so moving /lib was bad. It broke all commands. I fumbled blindly in the dark trying to get functionality back but many commands such as cp/ls etc were broken giving similar error results. I then rebooted and redid the mounting/mapping process. I attempted to chroot but that was broken still. I then moved /usr/libold/*.* back to /lib this then allowed me to perform chroot etc. By copying just *.* instead of all of it I think that resolved the issue. As the wiki told when you get the file exists in filesystem, you need to remove all instances in the /lib that are owned by other programs etc. running : grep '^lib/' /var/lib/pacman/local/*/files and  find /lib -exec pacman -Qo -- {} + didn't return anything owned by other programs. Everything was owned by glibc. There were a couple that those commands couldn't determine the owner.  The first time I mounted the drives and did the update I attempted to perform a "mkinitcpio -p linux" and it failed with an error about some modules. I believe that these modules were in their own directory in /lib and that they were the ones causing the update of glibc to fail. By only copying /usr/libold/*.* instead of a recursive copy I left the bad files out and prevented them from screwing stuff up. 
After the copy I then did : 
pacman -Syu 
pacman -Su
mkinitcpio -p linux
This mkinit then ran fine. I rebooted and it all worked fine with the update and finding /sda1. 
I did an update inside openbox and it worked ran without a hitch. There were no files to update but that was to be expected since I had just done that.
At one point I had done pacman -U http://pkgbuild.com/~allan/glibc-2.16.0-1-<arch>.pkg.tar.xz with <arch> replaced by i686. The wiki stated that this would save a bit of trouble when updating if it hadn't been updated to that level of glibc yet. It ran without a hitch. I'm not sure if in the end that helped or hurt. My final update updated glibc to 2.16.0.5.


FStab problem w/ bignicky HDD transfer to Dell
the fstab had entries for automounting the 2nd HDD,dvd, and card reader
The 2nd HDD was creating this error
"fsck.ext4:No such file or directory while trying to open /dev/sdb1
Possibly non-existent device?"
I could then reboot or perform maintenance as root.
I had to log in as root, comment out hte offending line and reboot. I also had to remount the HDD as rw b/c by default it is mounted read only.

Non resposive or dead laptop screen (dead backlight) + external monitor and BIOS
Typically with an external monitor hooked up you will net get the BIOS screen to show up on the external monitor without some user intervention. At the bar minimum you'll need to know the keypress sequence to get into the BIOS screen. Alternatively you can just mash on the keyboard hoping you struck the required key. Or just google it.
Once in the BIOS screen send the video output to the external display. On the Dell inspiron 2200 this is done by pressing FnF8. You will now see the BIOS screen on the external monitor.

xorg update -> low resolution 
after an update that involved xorg, the resolution was set low. I think some nvidia drivers were set to be the new drivers as examining the xorg log showed an error about no nvidia driver being found or unable to load. I simply copied an old archived xorg.conf file to xorg.conf. I wasn't sure if this would work as there currently wasn't an xorg.conf int he directory. however this did seem to solve the problem 

Tab autocompletion adds trailing space
this occurred after installing Adobe Acrobat Reader. The solution appeared to be teh suggested deletion of /etc/bash_completion.d/acroread.sh (yet I was looking in just bash_completion.

Anyway I solved the problem by editing /etc/bash_completion line 1587 from -o default to -o filenameas as suggested by a poster. Problem solved. bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/acroread/+bug/769866

SSH sshd -D
I wasn't able to connect to Nicky or Nicolae via ssh after putting them on the wireless at home. I thougt it was a problem with the router and computers being wireless. Some links I foudn suggested that some special configuration was needed in the router besides port forwarding.
The problem was that sshd was being started w/ the -D switch which doesn't start it as a daemon. I could connect but only while I started a loopback ssh session on the particular machine and left it running. I couldn't figure out where to go to prevent the -D switch from being invoked on startup. I looked in Startup applications and in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. 
To get rid of it I just remvoed, purged,cleaned, & reinstalled openssh-server.
To properly solve the problem edit /etc/init/ssh.conf
In retrospect running ps aux | grep ssh and examining the options being passed would've helped to solve the problem. Well live and learn.

The preceding example redirects the standard output into a file by using the > operator. By default, if the
file already exists, then it will be overwritten. If you want to change the default behavior, you can use
the command set -o noclobber (or set -C), which sets the noclobber option to prevent a file from
being overwritten using redirection. You can cancel this option using set +o noclobber.

Unable to mount 2.0 TB Filesystem

Error mounting: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb4, missing codepage or helper program, or other error In some cases useful info is found in syslog -try dmesg | tail or so
Trying to extract data from a 'bricked' Western Digital MyBook Live 2tb drive.

I came across a forum that advised to use Ubuntu (booted from a CD) on my Macbook. Managed to download and create a boot CD for Ubuntu (like this little operating system btw). Booted the machine with the CD and plugged the drive (which I had extracted from it's casing and placed into a external USB SATA case & plugged to the laptop). The drive is seen by Ubuntu but each time I click on the drive, it gives me the following error:

PyGTK has been deprecated in favor of PyGI+GTK. Because of that, a version of PyGTK for Python 3 was never written.
To use PyGI+GTK in Python 3, you need to install the python-gobject and gtk3 packages and do

both of these work. The second is more compact and allows for non alpha characters in the filename, although a poster did complain that on their system it didn't work.

Emacs GPG decryption failed.
Received: emacs epa-file--find-file-not-found-function decryption failed
This happened after I updated. I thought something changed during the update. I should know better that the updated is proly QCed pretty well so it was me and not the software.
In the end I thought I had put in the passphrase with capslock on when it actually wasn't. 
for a simple check instead of invoking emacs every time you can simply use gpg -d(ecrypt) file to check the decryption. 
gpg doesn't use a GUI, it uses ncurses style prompt. It does create a plaintext file removing the .gpg from the filename. e.g. gpg -d bob.txt.gpg creates a bob.txt file.

symlink: I was doing symbolic links incorrectly. I was assuming it goes  ' ln -s From To' when it goes ' ln -s To From'
'ln -s  ~/Git/Fonts/ ~/.fonts' puts a link Fonts in /.fonts that links to the Git/Fronts directory
to see the symlink and where it points you need to do a long listing of the directory/file

Any time a new font is added (to ~/.fonts if single user or /usr/share/fonts for global use) you need to update the fontconfig cache:
fc-cache -vf

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2627289/how-to-replace-a-region-in-emacs-with-yank-buffer-contents basically you have to edit your .emacs profile or you can use registers
Add this to your .emacs:

(delete-selection-mode 1)
Anything that writes to the buffer while the region is active will overwrite it, including paste, but also simply typing something or hitting backspace

|-----
Setting delete-selection-mode, as Michael suggested, seems the most natural way to do it.

However, that's not what I do :) Instead, I put the good stuff into a "register" -- for eample, register "a" -- with C-x r x a. Then I kill the other copy, and copy the register into the same spot with C-x r g a.

This is convenient because killing doesn't affect the registers, so C-x r g a always inserts the good stuff.

|-----
The default way to do something like this is the not-entirely-elegant following:

Get your desired replacement text into the kill ring somehow (e.g., M-w).
Highlight the region to be replaced.
Delete it (C-w).
Replace it with the prior-copied region (C-y, M-y). This replaces the freshly deleted contents with the exact same text that you just deleted (C-y), and then re-replaces it with the next most-recently saved buffer in the buffer ring (M-y).
This would get to be a real pain if you wanted to do this 10 times with the same text, as the desired replacement would get pushed farther back in the kill ring each time you deleted a region, so you'd have to call M-w an increasing number of times each time you wanted to yank it.

I copied my thinkbank.gpg file from the cam laptop to big nicky and I could access the file using the key. I find this a bit strange since I thought the gpg key had to do with the key on the filesystem it was created with. I know the key I used to encrypt the file is diff than the system wide key I use. So I'm curious as to how gpg works since I thought the gpg agent needed to access the keys in the /etc/ssh directory to decrypt the file. This makes me scared since I feel like anyone could decrypt this file then. I am pretty sure that this isn't the case but it goes to show how little I understand of the gpg agent/encryption.

I'd like to essentially tar/gz a directory on a remote machine and save the file to my local computer without having to connect back into my local machine from the remote one. Is there a way to do this over SSH? The tar file doesn't need to be stored on the remote machine, only on the local machine. Is this possible?
-->You can do it with an ssh command, just tell tar to create the archive on its standard output:

ssh remote.example.com 'cd /path/to/directory && tar -cf - foo | gzip -9' >foo.tgz
Another approach, which is more convenient if you want to do a lot of file manipulations on the other machine but is overkill for a one-shot archive creation, is to mount the remote machine's filesystem with SSHFS (a FUSE filesystem). You should enable compression at the SSH level.

mkdir ~/net/remote.example.com
sshfs -C remote.example.com:/ ~/net/remote.example.com
tar -czf foo.tgz -C ~/net/remote.example.com/path/to/directory foo

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7714900/remove-only-files-in-directory-on-linux-not-directories
You can use find with -type f for files only and -maxdepth 1 so find won't search for files in sub-directories of /path/to/directory. rm -i will prompt you on each delete so you can confirm or deny the delete. If you dont care about being asked for confirmation of each delete, change it to rm -fv (-f for force the delete). The -v flag makes it so that with each delete, a message is printed saying what file was just deleted.

find /path/to/directory -type f -maxdepth 1 -exec rm -iv {} \;
This should meet the criteria:

NOT directories 
NOT subdirectories 
NOT files in these subdirectories.

I tried to update the bios inside linux on the dell d820 using these instructions http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Tech/libsmbios_dellBiosUpdate. I was in a livecd of crunchbang when I did it and it appeared to go off without a problem. When I rebooted the lights came on for a split second and then they went off with a weird click. No screen came up or anythign. Crap I fubared the bios.
I then stumbled upon this for http://forums.mydigitallife.info/threads/13605-About-Dell-BIOS-recovery. It appears that the right terminology is bios recovery. I had been looking up bricked bios / flash bios which mostly led to traditional methods to flash the bios that relied on a working bios. I did need a windows machine to extract the hdr image (step 2).
1. Download BIOS file from Dell: http://ftp.dell.com/bios;
2. Extract HDR file from EXE: xxxxxx.exe -writehdrfile, a file xxxxxx.hdr will be there;
3. Copy xxxxxx.hdr to a formatted floppy disk or USB disk (U disk is not fit for D410 / D610);
4. Rename xxxxxx.hdr to the right file name according to below list;
4. Unplug AC adapter and battery from the bricked laptop;
5. Plug USB-Floppy with the disk prepared;
6. Holding press "END" on the keyboard, plug AC Adapter;
7. Then you will find that the battery light is on with red;
8. Release "END" (when the battery light is on), you will find the power light is on and laptop power up; If you wait the battery light will go off and the system won't start the update and you'll have to restart by unplugging the ac adapter. You'll see the usb flash showing that it is reading. 
9. Keep waiting... USB-Floppy will start to work. A continuous reading instead of a short seek action. Keep waiting...
10. Finally, the lapop shutdown or restart.

It didn't work without the file named BREW????.hdr. I initially just left it as D820_A10.hdr but it didn't recognize it.  The USB didn't need to be empty besides the hdr file. And I didn't have to try other usb ports to get it to work. It worked right off the bat on the ones on the side. 

I suppose this could be used as an alternate method to flash the bios esp when the latest bios isn't available in the repos for linux.

It appears that other keystrokes may be required to boot the usb on other systems. I know the dell mini 9 had a diff keystroke command.

to get emacs and easy pg to work on ubuntu/nicolae
I had to install easypg and add
(require 'epa-file)
(epa-file-enable)
to my .emacs file which didn't exist yet.
this emacs didn't use the gui for password entry which was nice. It was using ssh-agent I believe. It was a process present when running ps aux when I was being prompted for my pwd for a file that was being opened in emacs in gpg mode.

word on the street is if you remove gpg-agent it'll default to ssh-agent which will be run from the cli mini-buffer in emacs.

BigNicky Arch wasn't booting consitently. It was complaining that there wasn't a primary HDD to boot off of. I opened the case and pushed the cables in and things seem to be going much better.
I updated and it appears like there was some type of pulseaudio error when I would start openbox. It would flood the screen with kernel panic errors etc. I thought it was crashing the entire system but I could switch ttys around and make it back to tty7 and the openbox session was up and running. 
However inside openbox firefox kept crashing when I was browsing. I was browsing on imgur when it would crash but nto sure if it was solely imgur or other stuff.

I have been trying to clear out Djinnius and it was over disk quota. One culprit was spam on my wordpress blog. So I turned commenting off as I hadn't posted anything there for a coon's age. At first I didn't go all the way to the bottom and save the setting. Regardless the spam was still taking up 80mb of space in the database even though I was expecting it to be gone. 
I didn't reclaim the space until I went into phpmyadmin and clicked on the wp_comments table in _wordpress. I then clicked on the Structure tab at the top.
This opened a new view. In that view at the bottom there was a section entitled 'space usage' on the left. The overhead of the table was atrocious. Underneath it there as a button that said 'optimize table' it then simply ran the query "optimize table `wp_comments`" and it reclaimed the space getting rid of the overhead.

Arch Linux : Blank Screen Login
The Hampel laptop was booting fine with the display showing various messages while booting but then right before the login page, the screen would clear and go blank. I could then type in my username and password blindly and blindly run X and proceed find. To solve this I had to initiate an early KMS start as outlined here:  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernel_Mode_Setting
/etc/mkinitcpio.conf
MODULES="i915"  <-- for the intel gfx card.
then
mkinitcpio -p linux

On the hampel laptop, I could run the speaker-test outlined in the Arch wiki. However, when I would run icewm via xinit the audio wouldn't work. 
The answer is apparently to use startx to start icewm.

Actually 'case' is much much faster than even simple matching using 'if', and
can even do pattern and glob matching:
Code:

#!/bin/sh

thisString="1 2 3 4 5"
searchString="1 2"
# if you single quote your input, you could do this
# searchString=$1

case $thisString in
  # match exact string
  "$searchString") echo yep, it matches exactly;;
  
  # match start of string
  "$searchString"*) echo yep, it matches at the start ;;

  # match end of string
  *"$searchString") echo yep, it matches at the end ;;

  # searchString can be anywhere in thisString
  *"$searchString"*) echo yep, it matches in the middle somewhere ;;
  
  *) echo nope ;;

Unary unary operator in bash: 
unary = one. its expecting one argument to test like the [ $filename -e ] to test if it exists.
So if you're getting a unary op error its bc you're not using the right operand. you're giving more than one but the test is expecting just one.

I was setting up a new git repo for bitbucket.
I had done:
VehicleRecords]$ git remote add origin https://kklostermanoglu@bitbucket.org/kklostermanogluvehiclerecords.git
which is missing the / between my name and the name of the repo
the git add and commit went off successfully
[arch-nicky@arch-nicky VehicleRecords]$ git add Saab2003_93Arc.txt ; git commit -m "first commit"
[master (root-commit) 91e7452] first commit
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 Saab2003_93Arc.txt
but then I got this error message
[arch-nicky@arch-nicky VehicleRecords]$ git push -u origin master
fatal: https://kklostermanoglu@bitbucket.org/kklostermanogluvehiclerecords.git/info/refs?service=git-receive-pack not found: did you run git update-server-info on the server?
I couldn't just overwrite and be on my way.
[arch-nicky@arch-nicky VehicleRecords]$ git remote add origin https://kklostermanoglu@bitbucket.org/kklostermanoglu/vehiclerecords.git
fatal: remote origin already exists.
first rm the origin
[arch-nicky@arch-nicky VehicleRecords]$ git remote rm origin
check and see if there is one.
[arch-nicky@arch-nicky VehicleRecords]$ git remote
add the correct one. :)
[arch-nicky@arch-nicky VehicleRecords]$ git remote add origin https://kklostermanoglu@bitbucket.org/kklostermanoglu/vehiclerecords.git
[arch-nicky@arch-nicky VehicleRecords]$ git push -u origin master

Bignicky:
I was trying to print off a registration page and cups was complaining along the lines that "foomatic-rip-hplip"
   googled and didn't really find what I was looking for. So I reverted to https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Cups#Troubleshooting which has always been good. 
I tried printing via CLI instead of thru firefox: printHP ../ArchNotes.txt
I tried to use the hp-setup tool to add the printer but was failing at the final part when the tool was trying to finish the install. It was coming up with a message that was shown in the console as : Failed to get D-Bus connection: No connection to service manager.
I don't know why but I stumbled upon just reinstalling all the cups libs. 
I did this as outlined in the wiki.  sudo pacman -Syu hplip cups cups-filters ghostscript gsfonts
HP's ppd file was included so I didn't need to do anything there.
This still didn't solve the problem.
It ended up being that somehow the migration to systemd was causing dbus to not be started. Regardless I think the reinstall of the cups etc was worthwhile. 
Just to close the printing thread, once I got the dbus/systemd stuff sorted out it printed fine. 

My googling for the above problem enlightened me to the fact that I now needed to migrate to systemd to get things working properly.  There wasn't any specific problem that was exactly the same but there were hints that led me to systemd. 
As it was dbus wasn't running and systemd wasn't migrated too despite having been installed. 
I therefore had to change things so that systemd was properly installed. 
The install takes you through migrating from initscripts to systemd.
I'm not sure if going through that install got the dbus printing working.
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd
After that i had to enable networking as that wasn't coming up at boot. 
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Configuring_Network#Manual_connection_at_boot_using_systemd
At this point I didn't do much configuration with systemd so some other daemon services may need to be started.
Systemd doesn't rely so much on an init/config file. 
You use systemctl and that sets up the service to be started at every boot.

I had some problems with sshd as well.
I ps aux'ed it and saw that the -D option was there.
In the past that prevents it from getting daemonized , so despite it running it isn't allowing connections.
There is a previous entry where I ran into that problem before and the real solution is to edit /etc/init/ssh.conf
Well in the current version of arch there is no such file and I couldn't find a similar looking file.
I then went to the fallback of reinstalling as I couldn't see mention on the arch ssh wiki as to how to configure those command line options on startup. It only talked about ssh{d}_config files. 
Despite the -D switch still being there I could finally ssh into the box.

Merge binary files in git:
I had staged a commit of a gpg/binary file which then gave a merge conflict when trying to push it. I then stupidly tried to mv the file and pull so I could manually merge the files. This failed as the staged commit prevented me from doing that. So then I git rm'd the file which is no good bc then that prevents tracking of the file. I don't know how I got out of having the file removed. I guess bc I couldn't push the commit so the git rm never took effect. I made a copy of the .gpg file so I had my local changes. I then did a "git checkout <sha1> thinkbank.gpg" which gave me the proper binary file so I could properly append the new data to. also "git checkout HEAD thinkbank.gpg" came in handy when I tried to merge the local and remote the next day when I had to add in some stuff from work that wasn't added.  http://lostechies.com/joshuaflanagan/2010/01/29/how-to-resolve-a-binary-file-conflict-with-git/ see the "resolve using theirs section"
I got the sha1 of the proper commit via looking on my BitBucket account.  
failing steps:

although I'm not sure why it accepted the payload...oh I think that was where I git rm'd and then committed. So bc I rm'ed the conflicting file it didn't care about the conflict. Bc in the log on BBucket it showed 3 commits all at the same time. So I'm guessing this was all me screwing it all up.

Validate JSON 
http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/2144/validate-and-pretty-print-json-expressions.
zcat json_file.js.gz | python -m json.tool
cat json_file.json | python -m json.tool
http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/5074/validate-json couldn't get this to work so just hit up the jsonlint.com website

When editing and running scripts/programs its is pretty easy to just background the editor (ctrl-z) and drop to shell and then up arrow on the command line to execute the command and see output and then bring the editor back up with 'fg'. 

Would having my password.gpg file split into logins and passwords such that the user would have to decode both, be safer?

Sample code form Chapter 5 on up doesn't work: Can't set headers
I have worked my way successfully all the way to Chapter 5 without any problems. 
However, now I can't get the Chapter 5 code to run. I at first was looking for something wrong in my transcription of the code from book to editor but when I attempted to run the code I downloaded from the website I failed as well.
To be specific I get:
Code:
info  - socket.io started

http.js:708
    throw new Error('Can\'t set headers after they are sent.');
          ^
Error: Can't set headers after they are sent.

    at Object.oncomplete (fs.js:107:15)
The error occurs and crashes the page right away.
From googling, it appears that this error is a bit of a tricky one to pin down.
Can anyone else confirm that they are getting the error?

When I run the demo code, I run "npm install" in the base chapter05 directory and after that completes, I run "node nockmarket.js" with my local mongodb instance running. I do receive some warnings during the npm install but most are simple complaints about a missing README.md file with these others: 
Code:
npm WARN engine hawk@0.10.2: wanted: {"node":"0.8.x"} (current: {"node":"v0.10.2","npm":"1.2.15"})

npm WARN engine formidable@1.0.13: wanted: {"node":"<0.9.0"} (current: {"node":"v0.10.2","npm":"1.2.15"})

Are there any other details that may help get to the bottom of this mystery?

ANSWER: 
I found the answer to the problem.
There have been several breaking changes to node that broke the sockets.io portion of the code.
I needed to use an older version of node. I therefore installed nvm, the node version manager and installed v0.8.22.
I then needed to delete my node_modules directory and reperform the node install.
However, my system's python points to python3 and not python2. This was a problem for node-gyp. 
I therefore had to run "node install --python=/usr/bin/python2". After the install all worked nicely.

Revert a git file if you accidentally make mistakes to an uncommitted change:
git checkout filename
this will checkout the file from HEAD, overwriting your change.

Arch-Nicky / partition full so can't update packages.
You can literally just go in and start deleting packages from /var/cache/pacman/pkg
I just deleted a few of the biggest packages so that I could have enough space to complete the upgrade.

For merge conflicts, if you know that you are just going to overwrite what you get from the server, then just name the conflicting local file to the name of an unversioned file ie. nick.js ->nick.js.keep.  Then do a pull and it'll "update" nick.js and then you can simply move nick.js.keep to overwrite nick.js and then to commit etc etc.

Arch-Nicky (cam's old laptop)
It had been ~4+ months since the last reboot. I finally did that and luckily I remember that Arch was recommending moving from grub to systemd. Anyway I rebooted a couple times and it was ok, but then the last time it booted me into the grub shell. 
The solution for getting into my system is here: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=164570

grub>root (hd0,0)
grub>kernel /boot/vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda1 ro
grub>initrd /boot/initramfs-linux.img
grub>boot

I'm not really sure the update had anything to do with it. I think it was bc I wanted to shutdown the system and that was removed. I had to install systemd-sysvcompat to get it back. I think this might've caused the problem.
Further research shows that I was using GRUB Legacy which support for which was officially dropped. 
Hmm or it could be that in /etc/grub/ there was no menu.lst file. there was menu.lst.pacsave. but no menu.lst
Yes, it appeared to be that there was not menu.lst to go off of.

Cron scripts:
first check and see if crond is running
ps aux | grep crond
otherwise start it as root. it'll auto background
sudo crond
if you place scripts in /etc/cron.{hourly|daily|weekly} then you need to set it so that the script is executable and, I'm a little dubious about this one, you can't have a file extension.
Check to see which scripts will be run by the crond with 
run-parts --test /etc/cron.hourly/ 
you should see a list of the scripts that will be executed. 

Arch-Nicky started to decide that it would suspend when the lid is down.
change /etc/systemd/logind.conf and set HandleLidSwitch to 'ignore'

set time 
timedatectl set-time "2013-06-26 10:29:55"
check the status, locale, daylight savings time etc. 
timedatectl status
sync using the ntp daemon
sudo ntpd -q
