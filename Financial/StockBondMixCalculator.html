  This is an HTML table with <input> elements that allow the user to enter data
  and <span> elements in which the program can display its results.
  These elements have ids like "interest" and "years". These ids are used
  in the JavaScript code that follows the table. Note that some of the input
  elements define "onchange" or "onclick" event handlers. These specify strings
  of JavaScript code to be executed when the user enters data or clicks.

<div>
  <p>This is a js calculator to simulate depletion of your retirement savings. You can split your principal between stocks and bonds as well as entering an average return rate for each investment type. I also allow for simulation of a one time catastrophic stock market correction. You can specify the percentage amount and what year the catastrophe occurs. Your yearly expenditures and yearly growth in expenditures can be simulated as well.  You also have the option to enter in any benefits, such as social security, that help counteract eating away your retirement savings.
