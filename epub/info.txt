Emacs 
-----
You need to load the .el file and then 'M-x eval-buffer' then open the epub file.
I didn't really get to see a nice way to view the epub contents. It just seemed to 
show raw html content so you needed to read around the html tags :(
 EPubmode: This DID work
  http://sourceforge.net/p/epubmode/code/ci/master/tree/
 Epubmode - this *didn't* work; evaluating the buffer failed 
  http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs-se/EpubMode
also from http://inasmuch.as/2011/04/06/opening-epub-in-emacs/
add this to your .emacs:
(setq auto-mode-alist
 (append
 (list
 '("\\.epub$" . archive-mode))
 auto-mode-alist))
(setq auto-coding-alist
 (append
 (list
 '("\\.epub$" . no-conversion))
 auto-coding-alist))

Bash Script + Lynx
------------------
https://code.google.com/p/textallion/source/browse/contrib/others/epub-read.sh
for the lynx viewer you will also need the patch found here: http://www.mobileread.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=79788&d=1323429880
which I downloaded. 
You then need to apply the patch to the above bash file
 patch epub-read.sh epub-read_lynxviewer.patch
 epub-read.sh -v FooBar.epub

The -v switch uses lynx
I also turned images on in the lynx.conf file by adding the following.

XLOADIMAGE_COMMAND:feh %s &  //replace feh with your fav img viewer, xv etc etc.
MAKE_LINKS_FOR_ALL_IMAGES:TRUE
