Sourcing .alias file: I was trying to source .alias by adding code to source it if it existed in .bash_profile but this wasn't being picked up. I then moved the code to .bashrc and it was executed. Here is a good explanation of how / when things are being sourced: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/415403/whats-the-difference-between-bashrc-bash-profile-and-environment
a)
The main difference with shell config files is that some are only read by "login" shells (eg. when you login from another host, or login at the text console of a local unix machine). these are the ones called, say, .login or .profile or .zlogin (depending on which shell you're using).
Then you have config files that are read by "interactive" shells (as in, ones connected to a terminal (or pseudo-terminal in the case of, say, a terminal emulator running under a windowing system). these are the ones with names like .bashrc, .tcshrc, .zshrc, etc.
bash complicates this in that .bashrc is not only read by interactive shells, but also non-login shells, so you'll find most people end up telling their .bash_profile to also read .bashrc with something like
[[ -r ~/.bashrc ]] && . ~/.bashrc
Other shells behave differently - eg with zsh, .zshrc is always read for an interactive shell, whether it's a login one or not.
The manual page for bash explains the circumstances under which each file is read. Yes, behaviour is generally consistent between machines.
.profile is simply the login script filename originally used by /bin/sh. bash, being generally backwards-compatible with /bin/sh, will read .profile if one exists.
b)
That's simple. It's explained in man bash:
/bin/bash
       The bash executable
/etc/profile
       The systemwide initialization file, executed for login shells
~/.bash_profile
       The personal initialization file, executed for login shells
~/.bashrc
       The individual per-interactive-shell startup file
~/.bash_logout
       The individual login shell cleanup file, executed when a login shell exits
~/.inputrc
       Individual readline initialization file
Login shells are the ones that are read one you login (so, they are not executed when merely starting up xterm, for example). There are other ways to login. For example using an X display manager. Those have other ways to read and export environment variables at login time.
Also read the INVOCATION chapter in the manual. It says "The following paragraphs describe how bash executes its startup files.", i think that's a spot-on :) It explains what an "interactive" shell is too.
Bash does not know about .environment. I suspect that's a file of your distribution, to set environment variables independent of the shell that you drive.

Cygwin Navigation outside of cygwin directory:
http://superuser.com/questions/229870/how-to-access-different-directories-outside-cygwin-home-dir
You can access the root of your C: drive, for example, from cygwin by specifying the directory /cygdrive/c, e.g.,
$ cd /cygdrive/c
Similarly, the path to any file on your C: drive can be constructed by prefixing the Windows path (without the "C:" and with \s changed to /s) with /cygdrive/c, so C:\Dropbox\myfile would be accessed from within Cygwin as /cygdrive/c/Dropbox/myfile.
If you really wanted it available in Cygwin, besides getting it directly (as @garyjohn's correct answer) you can also try to use the mount command to map the path to your home dir. Something like this may work.
mount C:\dropbox\cygwin /home/me/dropbox
I say may, because though I'm pretty sure it will work, I have no Cygwin install to test it, and I'm not sure if Cygwin will refuse to create it because of filesystem loops (it should allow it)
As @starcorn mentions above, ln works great for this.
$ ln -sv /cygdrive/c/Users/JohnWagg/Dropbox/ ~/dropbox
`/home/JohnWagg/dropbox' -> `/cygdrive/c/Users/JohnWagg/Dropbox/'

PHP & MySQL: need to alias the count(*) fields bc php barfs when trying to pares it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/797335/mysql-count-into-php-variable
// Changed the query - there's no need for DISTINCT
// and aliased the count as "num"
$data = mysql_query('SELECT COUNT(`users_id`) AS num FROM `users_table`') or die(mysql_error());
// A COUNT query will always return 1 row
// (unless it fails, in which case we die above)
// Use fetch_assoc for a nice associative array - much easier to use
$row = mysql_fetch_assoc($data);
// Get the number of uses from the array
// 'num' is what we aliased the column as above
$numUsers = $row['num'];
---> because $row['count(*)'] ; doesn't work.

I brought in Cam's laptop and hooked it up to an external monitor. The screen image was showing up half way up the monitor. Other than that everything was copacetic. The mouse worked et etc. I waas at first going to blame X but it really was just that the vertical position on the monitor had been set way crazy.

I then attempted to sync up Git items but I was getting an error where "ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host\n fatal: Could not read from remote repository.\nPlease make sure you have the correct access rights\n and the repository exists." This was being caused by the ssh-agent not running. I am assuming that after the re-install I didn't have the ssh-agent automatically spawned like it was in the past or that somehow it changed.
eval $(ssh-agent)
and things are all ok.

Python 2 to 3: use 2to3 tool to modify code and create valid python 3 code from python 2
you'll need to make a backup of the file.
use the -w switch to write the changes out to the file.

CLI Expansions: (from http://lifehacker.com/5743814/become-a-command-line-ninja-with-these-time+saving-shortcuts)
When you're working with variations of a file—like backups or different file types—it can get tedious typing out the same commands with small tweaks. Using the brace symbols ({}), you can easily perform batch operations on multiple versions of a file.
Say you want to rename just part of a filename. Instead of typing out mv /path/to/file.txt /path/to/file.xml, you could just run:
    mv /path/to/file.{txt,xml}
This runs the command with the same arguments, only with the parts inside the brace changed—the first part corresponding to the first argument, the second part corresponding to the second argument.
The most common example of this is when you're backing up a file that you're making changes to. For example, if you are tweaking your rc.conf, you'll want to make a backup in case the new one doesn't work. So, to do so, you can just run:
    sudo cp /etc/rc.conf{,-old}
Putting nothing before the comma will just append -old to the filename after copying it with cp. If your new file doesn't work out and you want to restore the backed up file to its original location, you can just use:
    sudo mv /etc/rc.conf{-old,}
Moving the comma to the other end of the brace will remove -old from the end of the file and restore it to its original name.
The braces can also work when moving or creating multiple files at once. For example, if you wanted to create three numbered directories, you could just run:
    mkdir myfolder{1,2,3}
This will create three folders: myfolder1, myfolder2, and myfolder3.

mv: cannot move `./directory1' to `../directory2': Directory not empty (from http://desdecode.blogspot.com/2011/11/mv-cannot-move-directory1-to-directory2.html )
I wanted to move all files from one directory structure to another, for me I had an updated version of a lot of website files and I wanted to update them all in one go so I tried:
    mv ./directory1/* ./directory2/
Because I have lots of files within sub-directories on both folders the mv command wouldn't play nice and kept throwing this "Directory not empty" error, even doing an "mv -f" to force overrides didn't work..
After search around people have come up with elaborate bash scripts to do the task, and I like to throw a bash script together every now and again but in this situation it's really not necessary, we just need to use rsync:
    rsync -avh ./directory2/ ./directory1/
That rsync command will override all the files in directory1 with the files in directory2 and recurse through all sub-directories, it will override them regardless if they're older/newer/different sized etc so do a backup of your original directory before running the command

Emacs Mode for files not ending with '.py' : http://emacswiki.org/emacs/PythonProgrammingInEmacs#toc20
You can set the mode for python files with file names not ending with ..py. by adding line
# -*- python -*-
or
# -*- Mode: Python; tab-width: 4 -*-
as second line in your file (the first usually being #!/usr/bin/env python).
also http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/python/python/20112 states 
M-x python-mode or M-x load-file
may be needed first to load python-mode.el
or
I use this in my .emacs, which looks for the word "python" in
the shebang line:
------------------------------
(setq interpreter-mode-alist
(cons '("python" . python-mode) interpreter-mode-alist))
------------------------------ 
or
Check out the Emacs Info system for the topic Local Variables.
In short, at the *END* of the file you can have the following:
### Local Variables:
### mode:python
### tab-width:4
### End:
The important bits are a line containing "Local Variables:" , a line
containing "End: ", then any number variable names and values set
between those two lines. The lines can start with a comment character
appropriate for the contents of the file (e.g. "###" for Python).
or
You shouldn't need all that gunk. With most modern Emacsen, there's a
variable called interpreter-mode-alist which (at least with XEmacs)
has a default mapping for Python. Sticking
#! /usr/bin/env python
at the top of the file is enough to drop you in Python mode. This is
covered in the Python Mode installation instructions at
http://www.python.org/emacs/python-mode/installation.html
or
I bet there is someway to modify the python-mode.el file to accept other files types.

sqlite3 list tables in database:http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite.html or see below
sqlite3 check if table exists: from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1601151/how-do-i-check-in-sqlite-whether-a-table-exists and  http://sqlite.org/faq.html#q7
From within a C/C++ program (or a script using Tcl/Ruby/Perl/Python bindings) you can get access to table and index names by doing a SELECT on a special table named "SQLITE_MASTER". Every SQLite database has an SQLITE_MASTER table that defines the schema for the database. The SQLITE_MASTER table looks like this:

CREATE TABLE sqlite_master (
  type TEXT,
  name TEXT,
  tbl_name TEXT,
  rootpage INTEGER,
  sql TEXT
);
For tables, the type field will always be 'table' and the name field will be the name of the table. So to get a list of all tables in the database, use the following SELECT command:
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type='table'
ORDER BY name;
e.g.:sqlite3 IBDdatabase.sqlite " select case when tbl_name ='BC20StockData' then 1 else 0 end  from sqlite_master where type='table' and name='BC20StockData' order by name" 
-->returns 1 if it exists

-changing the "index" node changes which tab  is used. uses 1 based indexing and not 0 based.
I think this corresponds to the docIdentifier field.
If the index is set to an invalid identifier it will open a blank 'new tab' if you set the index field to a negative value or it will open the tab with the highest index for an index that is greater than the greatest valid identifier/index.
-use json_reformat and json_verify on the file. need to cat it in tho. or throw code into http://www.shell-tools.net/index.php?op=json_format or http://jsonlint.com/ to prettify the script and organize into a readable structure. Will need to run this 00> sed 's/,"children"/,\n"children"/g;s/{"url":/\n{"url":/g' to break up the single line entry into something that you can copy and paste into the online tool. 
-I've been successful in parsing the individual entries using : sed 's/{"entries":/\n{"entries":/g' sessionstore-18.js > sessionstore-18_entries.js and then copying the 'entries' line I separated and adding it into a brand new sessionstore file that was generated after the crash. 
-Even though most people don't have multiple windows there are also options/keywords in the xml/json for mutliple windows.
It doesn't look like there is a simple way to load sessionstore data into the browser without renaming the suspect files sessionstore.js and then 'rebooting' FF.
-The OP who started the bugzilla thread stated that using http://sessionmanager.mozdev.org stated that they installed sessionmanager.mozdev.org and hasn't had a repeat of the problem.

TypeError: GetTicker() takes no arguments (1 given)
--> this means that you forgot to define the function with the argument self i.e. def GetTicker() ---> def GetTicker(self):

Emacs
elisp file names must all be lower case. Otherwise, you'll get an "emacs required feature Somepackage.el was not provided"

Recursively make a copy of a file in the same directory with the extension changed.
find . -name "*.js" -exec sh -c 'name={}; cp $name ${name%.js}.ts' \;
--> this will recursively find *.js files and create *.ts copies in the same directory
find . -name "*.js" -exec bash -c 'name="{}"; cp "$name" "${name%.js}.ts"' \;
find allows you to execute a command directly on a file found using -exec; you don't need to pipe it through xargs. It takes the command name followed by arguments to the command, followed by a single argument ;, which you have to escape to avoid the shell interpreting it. find will replace any occurrence of {} in the command name or arguments with the file found.
In order call a command with the appropriate ending substituted, there are multiple approaches you can take, but a simple one is to use Bash's parameter expansion. You need to define a shell parameter that contains the name (in this case, I creatively chose name={}), and then you can use parameter expansion on it. ${variable%suffix} strips off suffix from the value of $variable; I then add on .ts to the end, and have the name I'm looking for.

Using a bash variable in a sed command
basically you need to use double quotes instead of single quotes.
I know that the first time I looked into this, doing this didn't solve my problem (Or at least I don't think it did)

$ bash ../JStoTS.sh
../JStoTS.sh: line 43: syntax error near unexpected token `$ts_file'
../JStoTS.sh: line 43: `CleanEndingParensBrackets() $ts_file'
--> this is because you need to remove the () on the function name when calling it. It is even optional when defining a function (although it adds to portability according to ans-guide.pdf).
